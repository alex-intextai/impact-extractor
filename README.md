# Impact Extractor: Prototype NLP Pipeline for Externality Detection

This project is a prototype system that ingests text from ESG reports and academic papers and extracts sentences or phrases that signal potential externalities such as environmental degradation, health impacts, or social consequences.

## ðŸ—‚ Essential Workflow Checklist

### 1. Text Extraction

- Extract text from PDF documents using **PyMuPDF**
- Location: `pdf_reader/reader.py`

### 2. Preprocessing

- Clean and segment extracted text into sentences
- Apply **spaCy** for:
  - Lemmatization
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Part-of-Speech tagging
- Location: `nlp/spacy_pipeline.py`

### 3. Classification

- Load a **pre-trained or fine-tuned Hugging Face transformer model**
- Classify each sentence as either externality-related or not
- Location: `models/classifier.py`

### 4. Extraction

- Identify and extract key phrases within classified sentences that signal externalities
- Examples: mentions of pollution, health risks, labor violations
- Location: `nlp/extractor.py`

### 5. Output

- Display the results in a **Streamlit interface**
- Location: `app/main.py`
- Save the extracted results to disk as JSON or CSV
- Output path: `data/outputs/`
